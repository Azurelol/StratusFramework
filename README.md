# StratusFramework
A framework of extensions to the Unity Engine, adding new functionality to it.

In this repository you will find the source code to the Stratus Framework, an Unity-focused framework for facilitating the composition of gameplay code.
Its major tenet is to provide useful features with an easy to use interface while removing of as much boilerplate code from your scripts as posssible.

Its major libraries are:
- Events: A custom event system using delegates that greatly simplifies the use of callbacks in code, for the implementation of code using the Observer pattern.
- Actions: An Action list library with a very simplified interface.
- Trace: A small library that decorates logging calls appropiately for quickly logging methods, member variables, etc.
